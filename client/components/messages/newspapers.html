<p>Advertising in Newspapers gives you an opportunity to reach out to your target audience. In order to get your brand’s advertising message out, you need to reach your consumers a number of times (i.e. frequency). Too little exposure and audiences will fail to notice the advertising. Too much, and recipients will be saturated. The Media Box is uniquely positioned to help you grow your business with highly effective, targeted print media buying.
Newspapers are the top traditional media source to influence purchase decisions. Newspapers advertising can span across multiple columns - and can even cover full page, half page, quarter page or other custom sizes. They are designed in high resolution colored and black/white formats providing higher visibility for the mass audiences of Newspapers.</p>
<p>The Journal of Advertising Research found “sound experimental evidence that newspaper advertising can stimulate an immediate response observable in purchasing terms.” In a study of 1200, one and a half days after ads for various brands ran in the newspaper:
<ul>
<li>14% more purchases of the brands advertised in the newspaper<li>
<li>10% greater brand share for the brands advertised in the newspaper</li>
</ul>
